##  summary

LavaShop machine from The Hackers Labs, we explore an attack vector that begins with the enumeration of hidden parameters through fuzzing, leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. After gaining initial access via SSH brute force, we move into a post-exploitation phase focused on gathering sensitive information from the system environment.

## Reconnaissance

#### Port Scanning

```bash
nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5555 -vvv -n -Pn -oG allPorts 192.168.1.70
```
